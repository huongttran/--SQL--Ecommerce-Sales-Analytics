## üì¢ Notes
### Note 1: Nested Data Structure

The `ga_sessions_*` table in Google Analytics has a nested and repeated structure:

- Each **session **contains multiple **hits**‚Üí `hits[]`

- Each **hit** may contain multiple **products** ‚Üí `hits.product[]`

When querying, you need to ‚Äúflatten‚Äù the data using:

>FROM ... ,
>
>UNNEST(hits), 
>
> UNNEST(hits.product)

‚Üí Each product inside a single session will be expanded into multiple rows.

‚ö†Ô∏è To **avoid data duplication**, only keep records with actual transactions: `WHERE product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL`

---
### Note 2: Revenue Units and Values (applies to Q3, Q6)

The field `product.productRevenue` is stored in micro-units (√ó10‚Å∂).
üëâ You must **divide** it by **1,000,000** to convert it to the original currency unit:

### Note 3: Action Type Classification
Tr∆∞·ªùng `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` m√¥ t·∫£ h√†nh ƒë·ªông th∆∞∆°ng m·∫°i ƒëi·ªán t·ª≠ m√† ng∆∞·ªùi d√πng th·ª±c hi·ªán trong m·ªói hit (l∆∞·ª£t t∆∞∆°ng t√°c) c·ªßa m·ªôt phi√™n truy c·∫≠p (session).
D∆∞·ªõi ƒë√¢y l√† c√°c gi√° tr·ªã ph·ªï bi·∫øn:

| action_type | Action Description             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | 
| `0`           | Unknown                        | 
| `1`           | Click through of product lists |
| `2`           | Product detail views           | 
| `3`           | Add product(s) to cart         | 
| `4`           | Remove product(s) from cart    | 
| `5`           | Check out                      | 
| `6`           | Completed purchase             |
| `7`           | Refund of purchase             | 
| `8`           | Checkout options               |

üëâ When calculating funnel ratios (view ‚Üí add_to_cart ‚Üí purchase):

- Filter action_type = 2 for product views

- Filter action_type = 3 for add-to-cart actions

- Filter action_type = 6 and productRevenue IS NOT NULL for valid purchases

---
### Note 4: Purchaser vs. Non-Purchaser Filtering Conditions

| Customer Group    | Filtering Condition                                                 | Description                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purchaser**     | `totals.transactions >= 1` and `product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL` | The user made at least one transaction with actual revenue |
| **Non-purchaser** | `totals.transactions IS NULL` and `product.productRevenue IS NULL`  | The user has no completed transactions or purchases        |

## Problem Statement
## üõí Introduction
> This project aims to explore e-commerce data in a simple and engaging way. Here, the focus is on uncovering how visitors behave, how much they spend, and what products capture their attention the most. By analyzing these patterns, the project seeks to build a deeper understanding of customer habits and inspire more personalized, data-driven decisions for a better shopping experience.
## üìÇ Dataset
The eCommerce dataset is publicly hosted on Google BigQuery. You can connect and explore it directly without downloading any files.
1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Open BigQuery and select your working project.
3. In the navigation panel, choose **Add Data** ‚Üí Search a **project**
   
  **`bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_`**
  
4. You can now write SQL queries directly in the BigQuery Editor.
### `ga_sessions`
<details>
<summary> View Description Table </summary>
   
Since the `ga_sessions` table contains a large number of fields, this project focuses only on the following key variables that are most relevant to project.
   
| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `fullVisitorId` | STRING | The unique visitor ID. |
| `date` | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| `totals.bounces` | INTEGER | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1; otherwise it is null. |
| `totals.hits` | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. |
| `totals.pageviews` | INTEGER | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| `totals.timeOnSite` | INTEGER | Total time on site (in seconds). |
| `totals.transactions` | INTEGER | Total number of e-commerce transactions within the session. |
| `trafficSource.source` | STRING | Source of traffic (search engine, referrer hostname, or UTM source). |
| `hits.eCommerceAction` | RECORD | Contains all e-commerce hits that occurred during the session. Each record entry represents an action (e.g., product view, add to cart, checkout, purchase). |
| `hits.eCommerceAction.action_type` | INTEGER | Indicates the type of e-commerce action. 1=Product list view, 2=Product detail view, 3=Add to cart, 4=Remove from cart, 5=Checkout, 6=Purchase, 7=Refund, 8=Checkout options, 0=Unknown. |
| `hits.product.productQuantity` | INTEGER | Quantity of the product purchased. |
| `hits.product.productRevenue` | INTEGER | Product revenue, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be 2400000). |
| `hits.product.productSKU` | STRING | Product SKU. |
| `hits.product.v2ProductName` | STRING | Product name. |
